This Project is for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game development using SGDK 2.11.
Development environment: VS Code with Genesis Code extension.
Always consult the Stephane-D/SGDK repository for accurate API information.
The goal of this project is to learn the SGDK and program a game within the confines restrictive hardware.
The game itself is a trainer for cave-like game mechanics, to learn and apply moves that relies on the order of movement in a grid-based cave game (like exploiting the left to right, top to bottom scans of the playfield to the player's advantage).
